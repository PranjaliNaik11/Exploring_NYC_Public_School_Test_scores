# NYC Public School SAT Score Analysis

Welcome to the NYC Public School SAT Score Analysis repository. This project provides a Python script for exploring SAT scores of New York City public schools. The SATs are standardized tests designed to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. They consist of three sections: reading, math, and writing, each scored out of a maximum of 800 points. Given their significance in college admissions, analyzing the performance of schools in these tests is crucial for various stakeholders, including policymakers, educators, researchers, government officials, and parents.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to offer a tool for stakeholders to analyze NYC public school SAT scores. The script helps answer three specific questions:
1. **Question 1**: Identify the best math schools with an average math SAT score greater than 80%.
2. **Question 2**: Determine the top 10 schools with the highest total SAT scores.
3. **Question 3**: Find the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation for SAT scores.

## Data
The dataset provided contains the following fields:
- **School Name**: Name of the school.
- **Borough Name**: Name of the borough where the school is located.
- **Building Code**: Unique identifier for the school building.
- **Average Math Score**: Average math SAT score for the school.
- **Average Reading Score**: Average reading SAT score for the school.
- **Average Writing Score**: Average writing SAT score for the school.
- **Percent of Students Tested**: Percentage of students who took the SATs at the school.

## Features
The Python script offers the following features:
- **Data Loading**: Load the SAT score data from the provided CSV file.
- **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
- **Analysis**: Answer the three specified questions by performing relevant calculations and filtering.
- **Visualizations**: Generate visualizations, if necessary, to aid in understanding the data.

## Usage
To use the script:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x is recommended).
3. Place your NYC public school SAT score data in CSV format in the repository directory.
